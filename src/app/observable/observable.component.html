    Observable in Angular is a feature that provides support for delivering messages between different parts of your single-page application. 
    This feature is frequently used in Angular because it is responsible for handling multiple values, 
    asynchronous programming in Javascript, and also event handling processes.

<p>
    Contrary to popular claims, Observables are not like EventEmitters nor are they like Promises for multiple values. 
    Observables may act like EventEmitters in some cases, namely when they are multicasted using RxJS Subjects, but usually they don't act like EventEmitters.
